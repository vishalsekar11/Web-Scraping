# Web-Scraping
In this project, we implemented web scraping of real websites using the BeautifulSoup library, facilitating the efficient extraction of desired data. Subsequently, we processed and organized the scraped data using Pandas Library. We exported  the extracted data in a CSV file, providing a well-structured dataset.
